**What if our forecasts should follow linear constraints?**

In this post, we explore the concept of hierarchical forecasting, a crucial aspect of many business operations. We take a detailed look at how forecasts can be reconciled when they need to follow linear constraints, such as ensuring that regional sales don't exceed national totals. The discussion delves into different methods to achieve coherent forecasts, including single-level approaches and more advanced reconciliation methods.
